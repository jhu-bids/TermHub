## Enclave wrangler
This [documentation can be found here](https://github.com/jhu-bids/TermHub/tree/develop/enclave_wrangler)

## Creating/Updating concept sets via CSV upload
Example: [sample CSV](https://github.com/jhu-bids/TermHub/blob/develop/test/input/test_enclave_wrangler/test_dataset_upload/type-2-diabetes-mellitus.csv).

### CSV Schema
At a minimum, all of these columns not marked 'Optional' in the description are necessary. Additional columns are allowable, but they will be ignored.

### Options for adding concepts
This can be done 1 of 2 ways: (a) by providing OMOP concept IDs in the `omop_concept_id` field, or (b) adding concepts directy from a source vocabulary, using the `vocabulary_id` and `vocabulary_concept_code` fields.

upload_new_cset_version_with_concepts_from_csv(path)
```

There is also a unit test that demonstrates this functionality in `tests/test_enclave_wrangler.py` called `TestEnclaveWrangler.test_upload()`.

# To do:
  - Add documentation here for how this can be run by users with Python skills
  - Give [upload_new_cset_version_with_concepts_from_csv](https://github.com/jhu-bids/TermHub/blob/main/enclave_wrangler/dataset_upload.py#L39-L90) features to allow:
    - Specifying user auth token so it can be run by people on their own behalf (who don't have the bulkimport user auth token)
    - Specify whether version(s) should be finalized or left in draft state.
  
# How to's
Access your security authorization token for the Enclave API:
  - Go to https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/slate/documents/dashboard
  - Go to "account"
  - Go to "settings"
  - Go to "tokens"
